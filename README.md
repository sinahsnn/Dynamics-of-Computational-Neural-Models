# Dynamics-of-Computational-Neural-Models
Simulation of different neuron models (Hodgkin Huxley, Izhikevich, and LIF) and neural populations using MATLAB and phase-plane analysis.
## Hodgkin-Huxley model
- the time constants plots and steady states for m, n, and h were plotted. 
- the membrane voltage was plotted. 
- The minimum amplitude of the stimulus for neuron spiking was calculated. 
- the minimum required time for stimulating for at least one spike was calculated 
the F-I graph was plotted. 
## Izhikevich model 
In this question, the Izhikevich model was implemented, and five patterns consisting of "Tonic spiking," "Phasic Spiking," "Tonic Bursting," "Phasic Bursting," and "Mixed Model" were modeled.
## Noisy Input Model
- this part involves simulation of the LIF model with random thresholding
- The PDF of thresholds is plotted, and the effect of input magnitude is discussed
- Firing rate - current diagram is plotted
## Phase plane
- this part plots the phase plane of a network of two neurons (an excitatory and inhibitory neuron)
- Effects of parameters (M_ee, M_ei, M_ie, M_ii) were investigated on the phase plane
## Modelling of a two-neuron network
this code simulates a two-neuron (excitatory/excitatory and inhibitory/inhibitory) network
excitatory/excitatory network spike continuously one after another
inhibitory/inhibitory neurons will become synchronized after a while
